# real-time-MNIST-python
This project will consist of a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset and use real-time visual input to classify hand-written digits. This project will make use of the OpenCV library and Tensorflow(CPU and GPU options).

# Neural Network
The network used for this project is just a basic neural network who's layer sizes can be specified.
=======
# Camera

The camera used for this project is a Logitech C930e, but should be able to be used with any kind of webcam.

This file will implement important functions related to use of the camera for classifying digits in real time.
