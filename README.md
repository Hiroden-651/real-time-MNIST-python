# real-time-MNIST-python
This project will consist of a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset and use real-time visual input to classify hand-written digits. This project will make use of the OpenCV library and Tensorflow(CPU and GPU options).

# Neural Network
The network used for this project is just a basic neural network who's layer sizes can be specified.
